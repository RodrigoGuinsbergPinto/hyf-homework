American Pancakes

Ingredients
    200g self-raising flour
    1 ½ tsp baking powder
    1 tbsp golden caster sugar
    3 large eggs
    25g melted butter, plus extra for cooking
    200ml milk
    vegetable oil, for cooking
To serve
    maple syrup
    toppings of your choice, such as cooked bacon, chocolate chips, blueberries or peanut butter and jam.

Method
    STEP 1
    Mix 200g self-raising flour, 1 ½ tsp baking powder, 1 tbsp golden caster sugar and a pinch of salt together in a large bowl.

    STEP 2
    Create a well in the centre with the back of your spoon then add 3 large eggs, 25g melted butter and 200ml milk.

    STEP 3
    Whisk together either with a balloon whisk or electric hand beaters until smooth then pour into a jug.

    STEP 4
    Heat a small knob of butter and 1 tsp of oil in a large, non-stick frying pan over a medium heat. When the butter looks frothy, pour in rounds of the batter, approximately 8cm wide. Make sure you don’t put the pancakes too close together as they will spread during cooking. Cook the pancakes on one side for about 1-2 mins or until lots of tiny bubbles start to appear and pop on the surface. Flip the pancakes over and cook for a further minute on the other side. Repeat until all the batter is used up.

    STEP 5
    Serve your pancakes stacked up on a plate with a drizzle of maple syrup and any of your favourite toppings.

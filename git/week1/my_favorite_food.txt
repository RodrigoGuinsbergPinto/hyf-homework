POPCORN
    How to make perfect popcorn!
Ingredients
    3 tablespoons coconut oil or extra virgin olive oil
    1/3 cup high quality popcorn kernels
    1 tablespoon butter or more to taste, optional
    Salt to taste
Method
 1-Heat the oil:
    Heat the oil in a 3-quart thick-bottomed saucepan on medium high heat. If you are using coconut oil, allow all of the solid oil to melt.
 2-Put 3 or 4 popcorn kernels into the oil:
    Wait for the popcorn kernels to pop.
 3-Add the rest of the popcorn:
    When the kernels pop, add the rest of the 1/3 cup of popcorn kernels in an even layer.
 4-Cover the pot, remove from heat and count 30 seconds:(Count out loud! It's fun to do with kids.)
    This method first heats the oil to the right temperature, then waiting 30 seconds brings all of the other kernels to a near-popping temperature so that when they are put back on the heat, they all pop at about the same time.
 5-Return the pan to the heat:
    The popcorn should begin popping soon, and all at once. Once the popping starts in earnest, gently shake the pan by moving it back and forth over the burner.
    Tip: As the popcorn pops, try to keep the lid slightly ajar to let the steam from the popcorn release (the popcorn will be drier and crisper).
 6-Once the popping slows to several seconds between pops, remove the pan from the heat:
    remove the lid, and dump the popcorn immediately into a wide bowl.
 7-Sprinkle the popcorn with salt to taste:

    Fun toppings for the popcorn - Spanish smoked paprika, nutritional yeast, cayenne powder, chili pepper, curry powder, cumin, grated Parmesan cheese.
    ENJOY IT!

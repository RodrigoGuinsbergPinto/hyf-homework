<!-- Hi dear reviewer.
It has been very challenging to learn to code, but I'm moving on.
Thank you for your time and for sharing your knowledge. 

First of all, I know I was told before to use "Prettier" to indent my code.
I do have it installed in my VS Code, but I change so much with my coding and in the end, I don't know how the indentation should really be.
Is there an action on VC Code/Prettier to check on my final indentation?-->

<!-- I was told by my mentor not to use id's.
  Is it ok to use id's here? Is there another option to link the internal links? -->

      <h3>web development as an industry</h3>
      <p>Examples of dramatic transformation in communication and commerce led by web development include e-commerce. Online auction sites such as eBay have changed the way consumers find and purchase goods and services. Online retailers such as Amazon.com and Buy.com (among many others) have transformed the shopping and bargain-hunting experience for many consumers.</p>

      <h2>Practical web development</h2>
      <p>Since the commercialization of the web, web development has been a growing industry. The growth of this industry is being driven by businesses wishing to use their website to sell and services to customers. [1]</p>
      <p>There is open source software for web development like BerkeleyDB, GlassFish, LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP) stack and Perl/Plack. This has kept the cost of learning web development to a minimum. Another contributing factor to the growth of the industry has been the rise of easy-to-use WYSIWYG web-development software, such as Adobe Dreamweaver, BlueGriffon and Microsoft Visual Studio. Knowledge of HyperText Markup Language (HTML) or of programming languages is still required to use such software, but the basics can be learned and implemented quickly with the help of help files, technical books, internet tutorials or training or face-to-face training.</p>
      <p>An ever growing set of tools and technologies have helped developers build more dynamic and interactive websites. Further, web developers now help to deliver applications as web services which were traditionally only available as applications on a desk-based computer. This has allowed for many opportunities to decentralize information and media distribution. Examples can be seen with the rise of cloud services such as Adobe Creative Cloud, Dropbox and Google Docs. These web services allow users to interact with applications from many locations, instead of being tied to a specific workstation for their application environment.</p>
